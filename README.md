Recommendations:
  - should do more offers in the last month before the spike like have a free month, so they can expand their suscripstions. in the spike months they should do more ads to improve brand awarness.
  - should make a point system, the more you use the more point you get, which used for future offers. make for example double points if you use it in the low rush times.
  - in the winter season, should be more active in socail media by doing a lot of entertaning content to keep the users engaged in the whole year.
  - new users give them like 2 to 5 minutes with no charging each journy for whole month, which make it a habbit to use the bikes in the future.
